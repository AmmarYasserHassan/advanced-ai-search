# Save R2D2

This was a university project done in collaboration with [Omar Kamal](https://github.com/oakamel) and [Omar Salah](https://github.com/omartarek28) in which we provide an implementation of various logic-based Artificial 
Intelligence approaches in [java](https://www.oracle.com/java/).

This software helps R2D2 from [Star Wars](https://www.starwars.com/) 
escape from the a grid in which it is trapped and it must find a way to the portal.


Algorithms Implemented:
* Breadth First Search
* Depth First Search
* Iterative Deepening Search
* Uniform Cost Search
* Greedy Search
* A* Star 

Along those basic algorithms the agent implementation uses admissible heuristics to make the search even more feasible.
Finally, to handle the everlasting undesirable downsides of most intractable problems in AI, 
a custome encoding mechanism employing the usage of hash 
functions were used to encode, store and eliminate the repeated states.
